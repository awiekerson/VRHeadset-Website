<b> VR Headset Website Design</b> 

I developed a VR headset website from scratch using HTML and CSS, based on a design I found online. The site is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly across various devices, including large desktops, small desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

The website features fundamental HTML and CSS concepts, structured with a header,hero , body, and footer. I utilized Flexbox extensively to achieve a clean and modern layout.

Currently, the site is static and does not incorporate JavaScript, but I plan to enhance its functionality in future projects.

Check out the finalized website here: <a target="_blank" href="https://awiekerson.github.io/VRHeadset-Website/">VR Headset Website</a>

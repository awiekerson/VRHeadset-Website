<b> VR Headset Website Design</b> 

I developed a responsive VR headset website from scratch, using HTML and CSS. While I replicated an existing design found online, I ensured that the site is fully responsive across various devices, including large desktops, small desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

The website features fundamental HTML and CSS concepts, structured with a header, hero section, body, and footer. I utilized flexbox extensively to achieve a clean and modern layout.

Currently, the site is static and does not incorporate JavaScript, but I plan to enhance its functionality in the future.
